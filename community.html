So, you've got your own copy of GoldenDog running and you want to find out more, talk to likeminded souls and enjoy the ride?
<p>Well, I have good news for you:</p>


If you are reading these lines it probably means that you're among the first people to try GoldenDog, because if this distro ever
became super popular, the website would be something more professional and you would have probably never read this in the first place!

<h4>So while you're at it, would you mind to give me a little hand?</h4>


<h3>GoldenDog Social Platforms</h3>

And that's it for socials, really. I am just one person behind this whole thing. Can't do more than this. Sowwy :(
